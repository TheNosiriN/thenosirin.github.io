# More than a Universe
I'm really proud of my Universe project, it has opened so many opportunities for me ever since I started telling people about it, but deep down I knew that the project would never be complete.

The way I created it restricted it to the limits of what we know exists out there, planets in a star system, stars in a galaxy, galaxies in a universe. That's pretty much the general way its structured in my universe.

But then I thought to myself... How big can I really go? Space in real life doesn't care about scale, it's just a bunch of particles moving however they want, as far as they want, and they clump together to form a bigger object, as big as they want. No restrictions.

The Universe is expanding, and we are inside its bubble. But space is infinite. Is there anything after than the Universe we're inside? Maybe that thing is much bigger. Maybe it's another universe? Or supergiant gas cloud. Instead of spending time imagining what it is, why don't I create it?

A space without restrictions, anything can be any size. From a gas cloud orders of magnitudes bigger than a universe, to a grain of sand, each having their own position in space.

## How can I create something that ambitious?
It sounds ambitious, yes, but "when there is a will, there is a way."


## Where to start
I think we would have to start with the coordinate system. In my universe project, the coordinates of every object is relative to the center of the object in the layer the observer is in. If they're in a galaxy, every star in there, and surrounding galaxies are relative to that galaxy.

I'm just starting this project so I don't know for sure, but I don't think that coordinate system is going to cut it for individual and independent objects in space. In this space the goal is for any object to be anywhere, from spaceships to planets.

I don't think 64 bits will be enough. So over the last few days I created a type that simulated 128, 256, 512, and 1024 bits of number precision.

```
2^512 = 1.34078079e154 micrometers = 1.417206413e132 light years
```

That is a lot of light years. But unfortunately, this will be really slow if I use these numbers for every object in space.
