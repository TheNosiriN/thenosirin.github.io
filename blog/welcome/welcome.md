# Welcome Page
This is the blog I use to rant about whatever I want. I talk about programming, projects, work, ideas, math, space, etc.


## Controls
At the top of the page, you can find a control bar where you can play/pause, rewind, set your reading speed, and fast forward.

You can also find an index on the left (on wide screens), or at the top (on tall screens). Use it to navigate and search for pages to read.


## How it works
Every blog post is written in markdown, parsed to html, and then typed by me in real-time. I include several pauses and transitions while I'm typing to grab your attention and provide a nice reading experience.


## Disclaimer
I created this blog, or rather this website, quite late, so some blog post dates before "May 2024" may not reflect the actual date I made the post or project.
