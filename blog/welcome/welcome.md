# Welcome Page
This is the blog I use to rant about whatever I want. I talk about programming, projects, work, etc.


## Controls
At the top of the page, you can find a semi-transparent control bar where you can play/pause, rewind, set your reading speed, and fast forward.

You can also find an index on the left (on wide screens), or at the top (on tall screens). Use it to navigate and search for pages to read.


## How it works
Every blog post is written in markdown, parsed to html, and dynamically inserted over time to this page you see here. It includes several pauses and transitions while being inserted over time to provide a nice reading experience.
